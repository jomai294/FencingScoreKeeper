# FencingScoreKeeper
App that allows fencers, parents, tournament organizers, and referees to keep track of matches.
Update: Right now I am still trying to get everything running, but feel free to track and monitor my progress.
Credit & inspiration given to Riposte. The UI and formatting of everything is given credit to those developers.
Goal & Future implementations:
    -Be able to detect the fencers names through camerafeed
    -Log in pool bout scoresheets through the camera
    -Autogenerate matches
    -Hopefully connect to FencingTime server in order to run tournaments quickly and more efficient (and hopefully save paper)
